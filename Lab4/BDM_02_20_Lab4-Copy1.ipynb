    "# Lab 4 - MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are practicing the MapReduce programming paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will complete the tasks using the accompanied *mapreduce* package (as **mapreduce.py**) and MRJob. Please download the **mapreduce.py** file from our online class resource page, and place it in the same folder with your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also install MRJob through **pip install mrjob**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each invocation of an MapREduce job (with mr.run()), you are expected to supply a mapper, a reducer and/or a combiner as needed. Below are sample usage of the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Run on input1 using your mapper1 and reducer1 function\n",
    "    output = list(mr.run(input1, mapper1, reducer1))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Run on input2 using only your mapper2, no reduce phase\n",
    "    output = list(mr.run(enumerate(input2), mapper2, combiner2))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Run on input3 using 2 nested MapReduce jobs\n",
    "    output = mr.run(mr.run(input3, mapper3, reducer3), mapper4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Please note that the input must be an iteratable of **key/value pairs**. If your inpu tdata does not have a key, you can simply add a null or index key through **enumerator(input)**. The output of the mr.run() is always a **generator**. You have to cast it to a list if you'd like to view, index or print it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks below also include those that are in Homework 2, but we're using MapReduce instead of Python's general Higher Order Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need **book.txt** and **citibike.csv** file from the class resource page."
