    "**Dataset:** We will use a subset of the open [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/ \"Enron Email Dataset\"), which contains approximately 10,000 simplified email headers from the Enron Corporation. You can download this dataset from NYU Classes as **enron_mails_small.csv**. The file contains 3 columns *Date*, *From*, and *To*. Their description is as follows:\n",

And the second one is a string showing the name of the two person in the following format: **'Jane Doe : John Doe'**. The names should be presented in the lexical order, i.e. there will not be a 'John Doe : Jane Doe' since 'Jane' is ordered before 'John.\n",
