## Instructions
- The entire homework is done using just core python library and nothing other than that.
- The ​ countminsketch.py ​ is a python file where count-min sketch data structure is constructed
and during its construction no other library but python core library is used.
- To run the ​ HW1_streaming.py​ file please include ​ countminsketch1.py ​ in the same directory
as ​ HW1_streaming.py ​ and then in command line
python ​ HW1_streaming.py ​ sale.csv output.csv
